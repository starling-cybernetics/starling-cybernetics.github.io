    <h1>Starling Cybernetics: Hello, World</h1>
    <p>Dear Reader,</p>
    <p><strong>Starling Cybernetics</strong> creates infrastructure for people and machines together
    to harmoniously achieve decentralized consensus.</p>
    <p>Created and directed by me, <strong>finch (@plaidfinch)</strong>, a founding core engineer
    for the <a href="https://penumbra.zone" target="_blank">Penumbra protocol</a>, Starling
    Cybernetics is a proud independent member of the Penumbra ecosystem. Among other activities, we
    are authoring and will maintain the Penumbra governance dashboard, and will also operate
    <strong>Starling Staking</strong>, an active validator which will run from genesis upon the
    launch of the Penumbra mainnet.</p>
    <p>In addition to validation and other infrastructure services, Starling Cybernetics also offers
    consulting and contracting for software projects both in and out of the blockchain space,
    drawing on our extensive background in applied cryptography and programming language design. If
    you're working on something interesting, we'd love to chat with you about it! Drop us a line any
    time at <a href="mailto:consulting@starlingcyber.net">consulting@starlingcyber.net</a>.</p>
    <p>For anything else, we love to get email at
    <a href="mailto:contact@starlingcyber.net">contact@starlingcyber.net</a>.</p>
    <p>May your today have blue skies,</p>
    <p>

    <p>P.S. Why the name? A murmuration of starlings is an open-loop feedback system computing a
    decentralized consensus for the motion of the flock. The emergent result is
