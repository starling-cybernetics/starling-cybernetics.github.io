    <h1>Starling Cybernetics: Hello, World</h1>
    <p>Dear Reader,</p>
    <p><strong>Starling Cybernetics</strong> creates and maintains vital infrastructure enabling
    people and machines together to harmoniously participate in decentralized consensus.</p>
    <p>Created and directed by me, <strong>finch (@plaidfinch)</strong>, a founding core engineer
    for the <a href="https://penumbra.zone" target="_blank">Penumbra protocol</a>, Starling
    Cybernetics is a proud member of the Penumbra ecosystem. Among other activities, we author and
    maintain the Penumbra governance dashboard and operate <strong>Starling Staking</strong>, an
    independent validator which will run from genesis upon the launch of the Penumbra mainnet.</p>
    <p>In addition to validation and other infrastructure services, Starling Cybernetics also offers
    consulting and contracting for software projects both in and out of the blockchain space,
    drawing on our extensive background in applied cryptography and programming language design. If
    you're working on something interesting, we'd love to chat with you about it!</p>
    <p>Drop us a line any time at <a
    href="mailto:contact@starlingcyber.net">contact@starlingcyber.net</a>.</p>
    <p>May your today have blue skies,</p>
    <p>

        Founder and Director<br/>

    <p>P.S. Why the name? A murmuration of flocking starlings is an open-loop feedback system
    computing a decentralized consensus algorithm to determine the motion of the flock. The emergent
    result is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV54oa0SyMc" target="_blank">vibrant living
    pattern</a>.</p>
